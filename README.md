Claude-managed task system spanning:
- **Fractal Shift** - AI consulting and strategic initiatives
- **Ziply Fiber** - Contract work and LFG staffing opportunities

- "Mark Fractal Shift website update as done"

Tasks are organized by:
- **Company** - Ziply, Fractal Shift, Personal
- **Priority** - P0 (urgent) → P3 (someday/maybe)
- **Type** - Strategic, Tactical, Technical, Administrative
- **Status** - Backlog → In Progress → Blocked → Waiting on Others → Done
